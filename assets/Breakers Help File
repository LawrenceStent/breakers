Breakers Surf Application Help File

===================================

This application's purpose is to show a number of Cape Town's surf spots. On selection of a particular
spot the user then goes into a new activity which shows that spots wave information, in minimum to maximum
wave height and the wind direction where the wave is. This allows the surfer to know whether the wave is
good to surf or not. In the new activity that is opened the user can then downloads and see's the latest user uploaded 
photos of that spot. The user can take a photo and then upload their own photo to the database along with a description 
of the wave as they see it. From there the user can retake the photo if they are unhappy or click upload, which opens
a dialog to add a description. 

The online database that I use is from Parse.com. This is a free server which allows for nosql storage of information.
I imported a library that my app uses. This library adds functionality in my IDE for Parse calls. These calls allow 
for upload and download of data as well as setting of users (although I have not yet implemented individual user functionality).

The mainActivity opens up a map of Cape Town with pins located at various surf spots. This covers Location based services.
I use async tasks twice, both in the creation of the breakInfo class which is developing Android threads. One is to perform 
the download of images and description from Parse.com, the other is to pull the surf api information from magicseaweed. These
two task cover network and socket programming, web services as well as database and file storage. 

Of the required technologies my app uses:
> Database or file storage of records;
> Networking and socket programming;
> Web services;
> Location based services (GPS);
> Developing Android Services and threads.

A problem I encountered while using the surf api, is that the api does not cover the amount of surf spots that I have
and wish to have in my application. Although this is a problem now and as such some surf spots will not have corresponding
api information. This can be countered in the future by taking ocean weather data and converting it for the desried spot.
Many of the surf spots have not been populated with photos.

There is much that I feel I still need to develop and have assigned space within my applications code to expand:

>Named User integration - so far each user is anonymous, will add facebook login so that the user can see their friends

>Full weather forecast 	- will add a button to the action bar so that the surfer can view a much more detailed weather
						  forecast for the spot that they are looking at. For a surfer this can be vital information.

>LiftClub feature		- This is a feature which I am going to take from a previous assignment whereby if one person
						  is going to a beach they make a notification and anyone else wanting to go can get picked up
						  and also go surfing.
						  
>Photo display & comments - On click of each photo, it will go into the photo to view it, which will then have a comments 
							section where different users can comment on one photo.
